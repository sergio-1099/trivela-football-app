# Trivela (Informative Football App)

## Where to Try

https://trivela-football.netlify.app/

## Description

Trivela is a web app built with React and deployed with Netlify. It uses a football api found here: https://www.football-data.org/

It displays the current league standings for a variety of European Leagues. It also gives users the option to view 3 previous season standings for each league. As of right now, the league standings are only shown for the Domestic Leagues as the other leagues such as the Champions League, Euros, and World Cup have different formats.

## Future Plans

- Work through different tournament formats
- Provide more information about other league stats (such as top goalscorers)
